# Recommender

A company granted access to KaDo: a database containing millions of bought items, divided in 3 categories. For instance, a bottle of red wine belongs to Famille: alcohol, Univers: wine, Maille: red wine.

In order to increase customers’ loyalty, the company expects to:
- segment the customers to get a clearer insight
- add charts and figures to help this company visualize their customers’ profiles
- build a recommender system to offer a gift to each client, based on their preferences
- use different type of recommender system: user based, item based. . .
- write a kickoff to describe precisely what to do with the dataset
